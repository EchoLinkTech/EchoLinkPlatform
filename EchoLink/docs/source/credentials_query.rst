Here you can preview the image you've uploaded with your credentials and can download it in your local system. Also, Once you've done the transaction, you can see the history of the transactions with time and address by clicking on :code:`Show Transactions history` button.

View Credentials: User Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can see on the demo above, there's :code:`view credential` option below the image you queried. Clicking on that will lead you to a new page which can serve as your public profile. You can access it anywhere without having to login.

The profile page will look like the one below.
