- For users

  + Sign up and login to the Token Bridge service
  + Transfer the EKO tokens to the address as shown under ``Send your EKO Tokens here`` section
  + Get the transaction hash of the transfer transaction and submit it to the section ``Give us the transaction hash``.

        password: 123456


  + Verify the transactions listed under `Submitted` section by clicking ``Verify All Transaction`` or verify them individually.

  + If the transaction is valid then, it will appear under the ``Verified`` section. Now, process the transactions by clicking `Process All Transaction` or process them individually.

  + Enter the private key to sign the transaction and perform the EKO network transaction.

If everything is valid the transaction will go through and the user will receive the EKO Energy over the EKO network.
