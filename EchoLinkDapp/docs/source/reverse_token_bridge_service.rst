Steps to use the Reverse Token Bridge service
---------------------------------------------

- For users

  - Sign up and login to the Reverse Token Bridge service
  - Transfer the EKO Energy to the address as shown under ``Send your EKO Energy here`` section
  - Get the transaction hash of the transfer transaction and submit it to the section ``Give us the transaction hash``.

  The admin will now be notified with the transaction details and after verifying and processing it the user will receive the requested EKO tokens over the main net.


- For admin

  + Login to the Reverse Token Bridge service

    - Credentials:

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        email: admin@eko.org
        password: 123456

  + Verify the transactions listed under ``Submitted`` section by clicking ``Verify All Transaction`` or verify them individually.

  + If the transaction is valid then, it will appear under the ``Verified`` section. Now, process the transactions by clicking `Process All Transaction` or process them individually.

  + Enter the private key to sign the transaction and perform the main net EKO token transfer transaction.

If everything is valid the transaction will go through and the user will receive the requested EKO token over the main net.
